## Puzzle continuation targets used searched depth-0 score instead of static material

Puzzle continuation extraction should stop when pure board material reaches the depth-8 target score for the candidate.

The generator used `checkers_ai_alpha_beta_evaluate_position(..., depth=0)` as its "eval0". After forced-move depth
extensions were introduced, depth-0 search was no longer purely static material and could change across non-capturing
moves due to forced tactical continuations.

The fix adds a dedicated public API `checkers_ai_evaluate_static_material()` and updates puzzle continuation building to
use that static evaluator for target matching.

## Full-game analysis rebuilt puzzle nodes from move replay instead of SGF state

Full-game analysis should reconstruct each target node from the SGF itself so setup-root puzzles, edited positions, and
variation nodes analyze the exact position shown in the UI.

The full-game worker built a move list for each SGF node and replayed those moves from a fresh default `Game`. That
ignored SGF setup properties such as `AE`, `AB`, `AW`, `ABK`, `AWK`, and `PL`, so setup-root puzzle nodes could fail
replay, report `replay skipped`, and end up with missing saved analysis.

The fix centralizes SGF node replay into a shared helper in `sgf_controller.c` that applies setup properties and moves
from root to the exact node. Full-game analysis now uses that helper instead of a move-only reconstruction path.

## Board men were raster-shrunk through GtkPicture and showed visible source pixels

The checker men should be rasterized at the final square size so their curved edges stay smooth.

`BoardSquare` rendered the procedural `GdkPaintable` men through `GtkPicture`. The paintable advertised a `64x64`
intrinsic size, but board squares are only `31x31`, so GTK shrank the already-rasterized result during picture
rendering. That exposed source pixels around ellipses and made the men look un-antialiased.

The fix replaces the `GtkPicture` path with direct cairo drawing in a `GtkDrawingArea` sized to the board square. The
same man renderer is now shared between the paintable snapshot path and direct square rendering, and a regression test
checks that the direct renderer produces partially covered edge pixels.

## Piece renderer centered men and kings from the same origin, leaving them visibly low

Men and kings should be vertically centered from their actual painted bounds, even though kings are stacked from two
layers with a different overall height.

The renderer anchored all layers around the same ellipse center. That put single men several logical units below center,
and the taller stacked king shape needed a different offset again, so both piece types looked low in their squares.

The fix computes the vertical origin from the layer count before drawing. Men and kings now use separate centering math,
and regression tests verify that both painted bounds are vertically centered.

## Puzzle attempts vanished on restart and could not be reported later

Puzzle mode should retain every started attempt so a wrong move, success, or Analyze abandonment survives shutdown and
can be uploaded later once the local threshold is met.

The original puzzle runtime lived only in `src/window.c` and kept no persistent attempt state. Once the user left the
puzzle, started another one, or quit the app, the result was gone. There was also no stable per-user identifier or
local history file for later reporting.

The fix adds a dedicated `src/puzzle_progress.c` module with a stable user ID, JSONL attempt history, threshold logic,
and upload payload construction. `GCheckersApplication` now owns the shared store and background flush requests, while
`GCheckersWindow` records one attempt per puzzle entry once the user actually makes a move.
